# Churn-Modeling# Churn Modeling

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **customer churn prediction**, aiming to identify customers who are likely to leave a service based on historical data.  
Churn modeling is a critical task in data-driven decision making, especially in subscription-based and service-oriented businesses.

The main goal of this project is to apply **machine learning techniques** to predict churn and analyze the key factors that influence customer retention.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Customer churn leads to significant revenue loss. By predicting churn in advance, businesses can take proactive actions such as targeted retention campaigns or service improvements.

In this project, a supervised learning approach is used to:
- Predict whether a customer will churn
- Understand the most influential features driving churn

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes customer-related features such as:
- Demographic information  
- Account and service usage details  
- Contract and billing-related attributes  

*(The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.)*

## ⚙️ Methodology
The following steps are implemented in this project:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding data distribution
   - Identifying correlations and churn patterns

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling
   - Train-test split

3. **Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest / XGBoost)
   - Model comparison based on performance metrics

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix
